# Potter Tongue for x86-64
> Simple Harry Potter influenced programming language.

This is an x86-64 compiler set for my [potter-tongue](https://github.com/tralf-strues/potter-tongue) programming language, which was originally written for my [software cpu emulator](https://github.com/tralf-strues/software-cpu).

## Installation
In order to install the compiler, you first have to install my [file-manager](https://github.com/tralf-strues/file-manager) library. Then do the following:
```Shell
$ git clone https://github.com/tralf-strues/potter-tongue-x86.git
$ make init
$ make
``` 

## Usage
There are many things this potter-tongue compiler can do. To get the idea of what flags it supports, just look at the help message
```
$ ./compiler.out -h
Simple Harry Potter influenced programming language set.
-S
        Write nasm listing of the program to the specified file.

-fdump-tokens
        Print parsed tokens in the following format:
        Token <token_number>:
                type = <type>[<type_number>]
                data = (<data-type>) <data>
                <line>|...<token>...
                          ^
        Here's a concrete example:
        Token 0:
                type = KEYWORD_TOKEN_TYPE[1]
                data = (keywordCode) PROG_START_KEYWORD[0] Godric's-Hollow
                1|Godric's-Hollow Hogwarts
                  ^

-fdump-tree-graph-simple
        Write simple graph dump in .svg format.

-fdump-tree-graph-detailed
        Write detailed graph dump in .svg format.

-open-tree-graph
        When written the graph dump, open it with the default program for viewing .svg format.

-fdump-tree
        Writes the syntax tree to file.

-fdump-symtab
        Prints the symbol table in the following format:

        ================ Symbol table ================
        functionsCount = <total number of functions>
        functions = { 
                { name='<>', varsCount=<>, paramsCount=<>, 
                  vars=['<>', ...] },
                ...
        }

        stringsCount = <total number of strings>
        strings = {
                { name='<>', content='<>'},
                ...
        }

-numeric
        Allow using numbers (e.g. '3' instead of 'tria', or '22').

-h
        Print this message.

-o
        Specify the output file.
```

Let's look at some of the options in more detail.
#### 1. NASM file generation
The compiler can generate NASM listring of the program being compiled. You just have to use the flag `-S` (*well, hello, gcc*) and specify the output file name after it.
```Shell
$ ./compiler.out program.txt -S program.nasm
```
Examples of generated NASM files can be found in [examples/programs](examples/programs) folder.

#### 2. Tree graph dumps 
There are two versions of graph tree dumps you can use - **simple** and **detailed**. The dumps are .svg files generated by [GraphViz](https://graphviz.org/) (so you would have to install it in order to use this feature). Here are the examples of trees generated from a simple [factorial]() program:

Simple|Detailed
------|--------
![](examples/readme/simple_graph_dump.svg)|![](examples/readme/detailed_graph_dump.svg)

You can also look at more scary :smiling_imp: big graph dumps:
- [detailed_dump_quadratic_equation.svg](examples/readme/detailed_dump_quadratic_equation.svg)
- [detailed_dump_insertion_sort.svg](examples/readme/detailed_dump_insertion_sort.svg)

#### 3. Tree text dump

This is used mostly for translating between languages that can dump the syntax tree in the same format (e.g. [vssense](https://github.com/vssense)'s [Drevniy-rus-language](https://github.com/vssense/Compiler) and mine share the same format). This is still a **work-in-progress**, though. It worked flawlessly with the first potter-tongue version, but I haven't yet adapted it to the new one.

#### 4. Symbol table dump

Dumps information about functions, variables and strings in a program. An example for [insertion_sort]() program:
```
================ Symbol table ================
functionsCount = 3
functions = {
    { name='love', varsCount=5, paramsCount=0, 
      vars=['precision', 'count', 'array', 'curIndex', 'swaps'] },

    { name='insertionSort', varsCount=6, paramsCount=2, 
      vars=['array', 'count', 'swaps', 'i', 'element', 'j'] },

    { name='printArray', varsCount=4, paramsCount=3, 
      vars=['array', 'count', 'precision', 'i'] }
}

stringsCount = 6
strings = {
    { name='AskPrecision', content='Enter the precision of numbers: ' },
    { name='AskCount', content='Enter the number of elements in the array: ' },
    { name='AskNumbers', content='Enter the elements of the array: ' },
    { name='SortingFinished', content='The array has been sorted with the total of ' },
    { name='(null)', content='\n' },
    { name='(null)', content=' swaps:' },
}
```

#### 5. Using numbers (and the magic goes away)
Simple as that, with flag `-numeric` you can without any problems (*other than moral ones, at least* :cry:) use numbers in a program. So you can write `-1` instead of `duo flipendo tria`.

## New language features
### 1. Switch from float to integer :abacus:
First things first, my language used floating-point numbers. Now I would like it to only be able to have integer type. Noninteger values will therefore have to be manually interpreted as fixed-point. This particularly means **no need in "colloshoo" (floor)** function. 

It's important to look at how working with fixed-point interpretation is done. Suppose, for example, we want to have precision equal to 4 digits after the decimal point. Several problem arise with this approach.

#### Arithmetic operations and sqrt
Let's look at how arithmetic operations change. *Addition* and *subtraction* stay the same. We just imagine there is no decimal point. *Multiplication* is a bit trickier - after it you would have to divide the result by the 10^precision (in our case 10^4). Similar to multiplication, *division* and *sqrt* are done by firstly multiplying the dividend by the 10^precision (in our case 10^4).
```
  22.0202        22.0202
+  9.1234      *  9.1234
  -------        -------
  31.1436   200.89909270
```

#### Input and output
This is where the dilemma occurs. Should I allow only integers to be printed and scanned? Or maybe add standard functions for working with noninteger values, even though there is no definite noninteger type, whatsoever? I have chosen the latter. 

In order to print values in the format `<integer-part>.<fractional-part>` with specified precision (e.g. "22.0202" for precision = 4), one is supposed to use the following syntax:
```
flagrate-bombarda <precision>, <expression>
flagrate-bombarda 4, 220202
```

Working with input is quite similar, though has several nuances:
```
accio-bombarda protego <precision> protego
accio-bombarda protego 4 protego
```
Here are different cases for precision equal to 4:
Input       | Return value | Case
------------|--------------|-------------------------------
*220202*    | 2202020000   | frac = 0
*22.0202*   | 220202       | frac = precision
*22.02*     | 220200       | frac < precision
*22.020202* | 220202       | frac > precision (truncation!)
> Here frac is length of the fractional part. 

### 2. Constant strings :scroll:
Strings are an integral part of almost all programming languages. That being said, potter-tongue doesn't support them :see_no_evil:. But not anymore! You can now declare ***global strings*** and ***pass strings to `flagrate`*** function, as well as switch to ***new line***.

#### Declaring global strings
Global strings can be declared pretty easily. Below a string called `<<The boy who lived>>` is declared. It contains string "Hello, World!" (without quotes). Note, that string declarations are allowed only ***before function declarations***!
```
Chapter <<StringName>>     "String"
Chapter <<TheBoyWhoLived>> "Hello, World!"
```

#### Passing strings to flagrate-s
A new version of flagrate has been added, called ***`flagrate-s`***. It can now be passed either a global or local string. The syntax looks like the following:
```
- flagrate-s <<TheBoyWhoLived>> (oNo) Prints "Hello, World!"
- flagrate-s "Hello, World!"    (oNo) The same as the previous
``` 

#### Writing new-line character
In order to switch printing to the next line, you can just use the `circumrota` keyword with flagrate.

```
- flagrate-s circumrota (oNo) Prints new-line character
```

### 3. Arrays :link:
Next, I decided to add arrays of integer numbers. They can be created in functions, but ***only inside the main scope*** of a function (i.e. you cannot declare them inside a conditional statement or loop!).
```
- capacious <ArrayName>, <Expression> (oNo) creates array of size Exression
```

Accessing elements of an array.
```
- capacious array, 32 (oNo) creates array 'array' of size 32

- array~0~ carpe-retractum 22  (oNo) array[0] = 22
- array~1~ carpe-retractum 02  (oNo) array[1] = 02
- array~2~ carpe-retractum 02  (oNo) array[2] = 02

(oNo) a = array[0] + array[1] + array[2] 
- avenseguim a carpe-retractum array~0~ epoximise array~1~ epoximise array~2~
```

### 4. Void functions :waning_crescent_moon:
Previously all functions were supposed to return something. With the introduction of void functions, the syntax for function declaration has to change. Now if you don't want a function to have a return value, then you specify it using the keyword `horcrux` before name of the function.
```
(oNo) Declares a function with a return value
imperio <FunctionName> <Params>
alohomora
    ...
colloportus

(oNo) Declares a function without a return value
imperio horcrux <FunctionName> <Params>
alohomora
    ...
colloportus
```

### New Potter Tongue grammar :pencil:

## Performance 
### Comparison with SCPU
I have compared performance of a program running on my software cpu emulator and on a real cpu. The [test program](examples/performance/performance_test_scpu.txt) is quite simple - it calculates the expression `n += (3 * n - 2) / 2 + 4` starting with `n = 0` a million times.

Here are the results:

SCPU|Real CPU
----|--------
21.263s|0.018s
> The test has been carried out on an i7 9750H Intel chip powered machine running Linux.

So that's about a **1,180 times performance boost** :rocket: :muscle:!
